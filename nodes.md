## API Node Recommendations

`Sqrl` is a fully functional wallet created by [EOS/Telos Miami](https://eos.miami/), which means it relies on an external API node `(with the history plugin enabled)` connected to the Telos Blockchain Network in order to function.

The list below contains Telos API nodes run by members of the Telos community that you can choose from.

### Privacy

Even though your keys never leave the `Sqrl` application, the API node you connect to can still reveal personally identifiable information about you. This information may include:

- Account Names
- IP Addresses

If you are concerned about revealing this information to any of these 3rd party API nodes, it is recommended you run your own API Node and connect to that.
